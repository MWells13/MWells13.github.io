            <h1>Michelle's Website</h1>
            Born and raised on a farm in Boone, Colorado, I grew up with three brothers, two sisters, my mom and my dad. I now have three nephews and two nieces who I absolutely adore. Being with my family is one of my favorite things in the world!
                Something that most all people know about me is I love sports, especially hockey, but I love baseball, basketball, and football as well. I am an aspiring play-by-play sports broadcaster and the goal is to one day become the play-by-play announcer for the Colorado Avalanche! Currently, I am a sophomore at CSU-Pueblo and a producer for Rev89, our on-campus radio station!
